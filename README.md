This repo is for the **oBundle** assessment test 


The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the Stencil CLI. I spent my first day installing the CLI and getting it running locally. The rest of the day was spent studying the code, getting familiar with the code and figuring out where I would be writing the code for the features that were requested. 

Features Added

1. Hover over image and get the second image to show.
By far the hardest feature to implement. After some trial and error, i finally got it working.

2. Create a button that adds all items to cart
Using JavaScript and HTML, the button adds the item on the screen to cart and a modal message alerts the user that it was successful

3. Create a button that clears the cart
It was about the same as the add button, but only appears if there are items in the cart. Both modals for add and clear cart automatically close after 2500 milliseconds (2.5 seconds).

Both buttons utilize  the StoreFront API for completion.

Bonus Feature

Create a banner that displays the user's name , email address and phone# 

The code checks if there's a user logged in, otherwise there is no banner. When a user is logged in, the banner states their name,  email address, and phone number.
